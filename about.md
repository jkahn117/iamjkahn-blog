Welcome to my blog.

After years of blogging on various platforms, I've tried to pull together almost 15 years of posts in one place. While mostly technical, you'll find a variety of topics discussed here, including a long ago trip to Australia.

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. The site is hosted using the [AWS Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/).

Enjoy!
