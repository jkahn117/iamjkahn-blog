<p>I wanted to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cairngen" target="_blank">Cairngen </a>in a recent project and quickly noticed that the standalone version of Flex Builder 3 does not have Ant support available by default.  Getting it set-up is pretty easy though:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Flex Builder, Help -&gt; Software Updates -&gt; Find and Install...</li>
<li>Select "Search for new features to install" and click Next</li>
<li>Pick "The Eclipse Project Updates" and click Finish</li>
<li>Expand "The Eclipse Project Updates" and "Eclipse 3.3.2"</li>
<li>Select "Eclipse Java Development Tools 3.3.2..." and click "Finish"</li>
<li>When prompted, select "Install All"</li>
<li>Restart Flex Builder</li>
</ol>
<p>When Flex Builder starts up again, you will have Ant support available (e.g. any build.xml files will have a little ant on the icon).  You can also verify by selecting Window -&gt; Other Views... and checked if an Ant directory exists.</p>
