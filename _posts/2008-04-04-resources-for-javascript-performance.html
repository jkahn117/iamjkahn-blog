<p>I've been doing some research on AJAX best practices of late and found a few links worth sharing / archiving:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" target="_blank">Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site</a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/high-performance-web-pages-20-new-best-practices?src=embed" target="_blank">presentation</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" target="_blank">YSlow</a>: Firefox extension from Yahoo for evaluating site performance with Firebug</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" target="_blank">YUI Compressor</a>: Compressor for CSS, JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, all are from Yahoo, but all seem to be useful, especially the tooling.</p>
